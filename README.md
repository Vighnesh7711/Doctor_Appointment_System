# Doctor_Appointment_System
 Finished our 4th-semester group project: a Doctor Appointment System.
 I built most of this system myself. It helps patients book appointments 
 with doctors easily.
 You can sign up, log in, and even use OTP to verify your account. 
 (approve or reject them), and handle patient documents like PDFs.

If anyone want's to contribute feel free.
