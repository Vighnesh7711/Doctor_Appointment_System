# Doctor_Appointment_System
## Finished our 4th-semester group project: a Doctor Appointment System.
## I built most of this system myself. It helps patients book appointments 
## with doctors easily.
## You can sign up, log in, and even use OTP to verify your account. 
## Doctors and staff can see available doctors, manage appointments
## (approve or reject them), and handle patient documents like PDFs.
